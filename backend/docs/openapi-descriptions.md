# StellarKraal API — Endpoint Reference

### Idempotency (`Idempotency-Key`)

`POST /loan/repay` (and the versioned alias `POST /api/v1/loans/{id}/repay`)
accepts an optional `Idempotency-Key` request header. When supplied, the server
records the response for that key and replays it on any subsequent request that
reuses the same key, preventing duplicate repayments caused by network retries.

| Header | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `Idempotency-Key` | No | Client-generated unique key (e.g. a UUID). Reusing a key returns the cached response (original status code) instead of creating a new repayment. Keys expire after 24 hours. |
